## Product vision statement

Our vision for CampusSwap is a marketplace where students can trade items with fellow college students. The platform will provide seamless connection between users and enable resource sharing between college students.

## User stories

1. As a user, I want to be able to sign up for an account so that I can access and utilize the marketplace as well as other features.

2. As a user, I want to be able to sign in to my account so that I can access and utilize the marketplace as well as other features.

3. As a user, I want to be able to browse the marketplace and view previews and titles of each item.

4. As a user, I want to be able to click on an individual listing so I can view more pictures, a more detailed description, and the name and rating of the seller.

5. As a user, I should be able to create a listing on the marketplace so other users can find my listing.

6. As a user, I should be able to include multiple photos, a title, a location, a detailed description, and a price/item to trade in my listing so I can better represent my product to other users.

7. As a user, I should be able to mark my listing as sold so others do not confuse my listing for one that is still active.

8. As a user, I should be able to filter/search for keywords that I am looking for in order to increase the chances of finding an item I want.
